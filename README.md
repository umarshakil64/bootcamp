#  Agentic Controller for Multi-Tool Query Handling

 Overview
This project implements a **lightweight agent** capable of decomposing complex queries into steps and dynamically selecting the right tool to answer them.  
The controller agent routes tasks to different tools such as **web search, calculator, document Q&A (RAG), and reasoning models**, showcasing multi-step reasoning across APIs.

##  Features
- Controller Agent â€“ Parses user queries and selects the appropriate tool.
- Integrated Tools:
  -  Web Search (Tavily API)  
  -  Calculator (Python execution in Colab)  
  -  Document Q&A using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with FAISS + embeddings  
  -  Reasoning Model (GSM8k fine-tuned model; experimental)
